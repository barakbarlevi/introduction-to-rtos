See my documented work [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17iRZOSI9rV7WkIdEc2UGUUsRfJ32uz7c/view?usp=sharing), where I provide an in-depth walkthrough of the code from the original repo, clarifying key concepts in FreeRTOS and ESP32 development.

This is a fork of Shawn Hymel's [introduction-to-rtos](https://github.com/ShawnHymel/introduction-to-rtos).
I followed his [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F321087yYy4&list=PLEBQazB0HUyQ4hAPU1cJED6t3DU0h34bz), working through FreeRTOS examples on an ESP32 Feather Huzzah.
Rather than modifying or adding new code, I've focused on thoroughly analyzing the original code, understanding how it works and explaining it in detail.
